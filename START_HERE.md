# START HERE: Complete Deployment Guide

Welcome! I've prepared everything you need to get your Clarity Finance Tracker fully working with signup, login, and data persistence.

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Your app currently has a **non-working signup form** because there's no backend. We're going to fix this by deploying:

1. **Database** (Supabase) - Stores your user accounts and transactions
2. **Backend API** (Render) - Handles signup, login, and data operations
3. **Frontend** (Vercel) - Your React app (already deployed, needs updating)

**Time Required**: 20-30 minutes total
**Cost**: FREE (all platforms have free tiers)
**Experience Required**: None - just follow the steps!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need a credit card?**
A: No! All three platforms (Supabase, Render, Vercel) offer free tiers without requiring a credit card.

**Q: Will my data be safe?**
A: Yes! Your passwords are encrypted with bcrypt, and your database is hosted on secure Supabase infrastructure.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Each step has a "Troubleshooting" section. Read the error messages and check those sections.

**Q: Can I use different platforms?**
A: Yes, but these guides are specifically written for Supabase + Render + Vercel. Other platforms will require different steps.

**Q: How long do free tiers last?**
A: Indefinitely! Free tiers include:
- Supabase: 500 MB database, 2GB bandwidth/month
- Render: 750 hours/month (plenty for personal use)
- Vercel: 100 GB bandwidth/month

**Q: Why is the app slow sometimes?**
A: Render's free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up. After that, it's fast!
