# Quick Fix for Vercel 404 Error

## The Issue
You're getting a 404 error because Vercel needs to be configured to serve your React SPA correctly.

## Solution - Update Vercel Settings

### Method 1: Through Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Vercel project settings:**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your Clarity project
   - Go to "Settings"

2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Framework Preset**: `Create React App`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect)
   - **Output Directory**: `build` (should auto-detect)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (should auto-detect)

3. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Go to "Environment Variables"
   - Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL` = your backend URL + `/api`
   - Example: `https://clarity-backend.onrender.com/api`

4. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to "Deployments"
   - Click the three dots (...) on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### Method 2: Delete and Reimport

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Delete the current deployment:**
   - Go to project Settings
   - Scroll to "Danger Zone"
   - Delete project

2. **Reimport fresh:**
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"
   - Import from GitHub
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set root directory to `frontend`
   - Deploy

## What Was Fixed in Code

The `vercel.json` has been updated to properly handle React Router:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React to handle routing.

## Test After Deployment

Once redeployed, your app should work at:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` ✅
- All routes should now work correctly ✅

## Still Having Issues?

### Check Vercel Logs:
1. Go to your deployment
2. Click "View Function Logs"
3. Look for build errors

### Common Issues:

**Build fails:**
- Make sure root directory is set to `frontend`
- Check that all dependencies are in package.json

**API calls fail:**
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set
- Make sure backend is deployed and running
- Check browser console for CORS errors

**Blank page:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify build completed successfully
